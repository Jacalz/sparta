# Sparta

Sparta is a Sport and Rehearsal Tracking Application. It lets the user write down and save all sport activities safely and privately on the computer. No tracking and absolutely zero collection of any user data. Activities are simply saved on the computer without outside interference. Sparta uses AES-256 encryption to keep all your data hidden from any spying eyes.

- [fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne) (version 1.2.2 or later)
